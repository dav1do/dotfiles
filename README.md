# Dotfiles

Most of these are optimized for my [keyboard layout](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/L4wD0/latest/0). And I need to sort out how to get `command` to work in alacritty/nvim so I can have alt back and not just use ctrl for everything. It will make this a real pain on my pc since I have ctrl<->command flipped on the map, so ctrl I'm used to is `windows` on pc :sad:.

Anyway, still a WIP.
